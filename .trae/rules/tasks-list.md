### Notes
- **Dependencies**: Ensure `qdrant-client`, `fastapi`, and `pyjwt` are installed. `chromadb` is optional for local testing. Configure `.env` with API keys and tokens.
- **Authentication**: Placeholder `user_id` from token; implement a real auth system (e.g., OAuth2) for production.
- **Scalability Path**: `QdrantClient` is the primary vector database for scalability. Ensure the `StrategyManager` is abstracted to allow for potential future changes.
- **Testing**: Use a separate `user_id` for each test to verify isolation.
- **StrategyBuilder Integration**: Ensure `conditions` are mappable to `MonitoringTaskCreate` using a structured format (e.g., JSON schema); add new tools if needed.
- **Monitoring API**: Use `/monitoring/tasks` for task management; align with `Strategy` structure.

### Implementation Phasing Guidance
To ensure a smooth and secure development process, adhere to the following phased implementation approach:

1.  **Prioritize Core Backend Logic (Phases 1 & 2):**
    *   Define the `Strategy` Data Model precisely using Pydantic, with a structured approach for conditions (e.g., JSON schema) to ensure safety and parseability.
    *   Implement `StrategyManager` focusing on CRUD operations for strategies, integrating with Qdrant.
    *   Enhance `OmnichainSynapseAgent` to correctly `_craft_strategy`, `load_strategies`, and interact with the `StrategyManager` and the monitoring API.
    *   Ensure secure condition parsing and evaluation, avoiding `eval()` at all costs.

2.  **Build Out API Endpoints (Phase 6):**
    *   Once the core agent logic and strategy management are stable, expose these functionalities via FastAPI endpoints in `run_agent_server.py`. This allows for testing the backend independently of the UI.
    *   Implement authentication early, even if simplified for development, to ensure the `user_id` flow is correct.

3.  **Integrate Monitoring & Notifications (Phases 3 & 4):**
    *   Ensure the mapping from your `Strategy` model to `MonitoringTaskCreate` is seamless. Test this integration thoroughly.
    *   Refine Telegram notifications to be informative and reliable.

4.  **Develop UI Components (Phase 5):**
    *   This can run somewhat in parallel with backend development, but it's best to have stable API endpoints to consume. Focus on a user-friendly experience for defining and managing strategies.

5.  **Continuous Testing (Phase 7):**
    *   Integrate unit and integration tests from the very beginning. Don't wait until the end. This will catch issues early and ensure stability.
